#st_crs() is used to checkk the crs of the data

# homework st_transform, what does it do?
#homework: differentiate between covariate and marks 
#eg earthquake: mag, depth are amrks, but the fault line is a covariate (covariates affect the distrubution of the point partten)

#check github sebnem github page 

#packages-> 

#download the shape file for South africa, shf zip from data.humandata.org for south africa data. get adminstrative level 0 ie the whole country
#then add a point pattern data onto the shape file 
```
